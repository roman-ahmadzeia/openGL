graphics pipeline explanation

1st phase: VERTEX SHADER
takes the positions of all the vertices and transforms them
once all done.

2nd Phase: SHAPE ASSEMBLY
the shape assembler takes all positions and connects them according to a primitive. 
Primitive: a shape like a triangle or a point or a line.

3rd Phase: GEOMETRY SHADER
adds vertices and creates new primitives out of existing primitives (complex, will come back to it later)

4th Phase: RASTERIZTION
Shapes get transformed into actual pixels (bunch of squares)
and has no colors.

5th Phase: FRAGMENT SHADER
adds colors to pixels that depend on lighting or textures or shadows you might have multiple colors on one pixel due to overlapping

Last Phase: Blending
